    <h1> Academic Background </h1>
    <p>
        I started at Ohio Universtiy in Biology and then moved into Classics after my freshman year. As a result I have a small amount of knowlage in biology and chemicstry and a pretty decent understand of archeology and latin. It was only last semester that I found out about the Universities ECT program and cahnged to that due to my love of VR technology.
